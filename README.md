# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

The dynamic app is made in Horinzontal way, we can make it vertical too .
To convert a React Bootstrap app from a horizontal layout to a vertical layout, you can use the following steps:

Replace the <Container> component with a <div> element that has a class name of "container" or "container-fluid".
Replace the <Row> component with a <div> element that has a class name of "row".
Replace the <Col> component with a <div> element that has a class name of "col".
Add the "flex-column" class to the top-level <div> element to make it a vertical layout.
Adjust any styles or classes that are specific to horizontal layouts to work with the new vertical layout.
